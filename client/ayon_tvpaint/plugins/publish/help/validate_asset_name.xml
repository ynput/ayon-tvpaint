<description>## Invalid product context

Context of the given product doesn't match your current scene.

### How to repair?

Yout can fix this with "Repair" button on the right. This will use '{expected_folder}' folder path and overwrite '{found_folder}' folder path in scene metadata.

After that restart publishing with Reload button.
